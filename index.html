            <p class="text_small">These materials were used at a stand of "10 years O-Platz" in Berlin. The interactive game has 4 parts / stations with a different focus each. For each station there are print-outs for the actual interactive part, and print-outs for hand-outs that people can take with them and that give all the information.</p>

            <div id="stations_flex">
                <p class="desc">Print out the big empty map and attach it to a pinboard (or similar). You need pins that have the names (and if you like, time periods) of the former German colonies attached to them. Then everyone can put the pin where they think they belong on the map. The hand-out lists all places and shows the correct answers.</p>

            <!-- <p class="text_small">With these interactive quizes and games, we hope to spread more knowledge about German colonialism, how it relates to people on the move and to queer rights criminalization, both during colonial times - by imperial powers like Germany or others - and in colonial afterlives. We also want to highlight the resistance taking place in many of these formerly colonized spaces to get informed, connected and inspired. </p> -->
            <p class="text_small">When creating this quiz, we did a lot of research on anti-queer laws in former German colonies, on the texts of these laws, what they criminalized, what terminology they used and also on the dates of passing these laws or what they can be traced back to. We noticed a huge archivial and research gap on this topic. So, we acknowledge that the presented facts in this quiz might have some gaps and cannot be always linked to deep historical, judicial or postcolonial research. If you have more resources or information, please contribute to create knowledge about this! </p>
